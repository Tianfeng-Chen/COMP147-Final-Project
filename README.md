# COMP147-Final-Project
This is my coding exam project for the COMP 147 computing theory course.

The code is located at the [**src**](src) folder. The [**Controller**](src/Controller) is the entrance of this project.
The code for the file processor is located at [**Model**](src/Model) folder.

I put all the testing source files in [**Util**](src/Util) folder. You can specify the file path in the [*controller object*](src/Controller/BooleanFormulaGeneratorController.java) by
using different filePath parameters. This project will process the file and provide the result in 
console and print the result into an output file with the same dir of the input file as well.

If you have any questions about the code, please let me know!
